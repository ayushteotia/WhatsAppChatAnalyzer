08/10/2020, 15:37 - +91 92190 61655: Respected Teachers

It may sound rude but despite our classes get over by 12:30 on Thursday and by 1:30 on Tuedays nowadays, it gets completed by 4:30. We are not complaining but ma'am this is too much. Currently we are having classes 4 days till 4:30. And this much of screentime is usually not recommended by any of the ophthalmologist. Sometimes it is okay ( twice in a week as we have as per our timetable). Also teachers, as per the PRAGYATI guideliness by the GOI, this much of screen time is not allowed that too without a break.
Also, our mobile data do not support this.
Respected teachers, please make a note of this for a conducive enviornment of study.
Thank you

First launched by IBM in 2011, the P-TECH (Pathways to Technology Early College High School) model has been adopted in 220 schools across 24 countries with over 150,000 students and 600 corporate partners. Open P-TECH scales the most essential workplace preparation elements of the P-TECH program making them available to more students than ever before. Open P-TECH provides modules for students and teachers that include courses on emerging technologies and courses on professional competencies, both leading to free digital badges that students can share on their online resumes. Using the platform, students preparing for internships and new collar jobs earn the same badges as professionals in the field. Initially launched across Australia, Brazil, India and the United States, Open P-TECH will bring components of the P-TECH model to 250,000 additional students in these countries, many of whom would otherwise not have access to innovative digital learning.

Benefits to Students:

a.        The intervention is in addition to the curriculum taught to students in colleges in order to make students standout from the rest to improve their future prospects.

b.        This will be a self-paced intervention, ensuring that the students will learn as per their convenience, without disturbing their existing schedule.

c.         This intervention would be supported by IBM and the students would get a chance to meet with IBM employees which would motivate and encourage them to take meaningful careers in the IT Sector.

d.        Student can attain a badge/certificate post completion of the course.

e.        There would be no financial liability on the college or the student.

f.         Through this program we would give them the much-required exposure to the necessary professional skills.

g.        The training duration would be a maximum of 7-20 hours for each student.

Way Forward for Proposed Intervention:

a.       Centum Foundation will share an activation link, which needs to be shared with the students.

b.      The student has to click on the link and register themselves using their email IDs.

c.       The student can enroll themselves on any of the following courses:

·         ISTE AI Foundations

·         Cyber security Fundamentals

·         Preparing for your first job

·         Professional Skills

·         Data Science Foundation

·         Build Your Own Chat box

·         IBM Block chain essentials

d.      The courses are self-paced and the student is eligible for IBM badge after completion of 30-40% of the course.

e.      The student who completes all the modules on any courses will receive an online IBM certification.

Respected Sir/Ma’am,

	We are sending this message to share the collective concerns of the students. 
We are aware of the fact that online academic year is meant to be difficult and hectic, and were prepared to work and have done our best, but given the pandemic as well as other stressors many of us may be facing at home, we feel unheard in many ways. We are feeling a lot of emotional burden and some of us are finding ourselves on the verge of a break down. 
We understand being online is meant to be stressful for both students and faculties as well, but this is getting a lot for us to handle. We understand that work has to be completed but we don't know how to anymore. Additionally, we've been unable to help out at home or do anything else given the second wave has hit each of us emotionally and mentally. We would appreciate it if classes could be suspended as per the compliance of orders by our Honorable CM Yogi Adityanath to ease the kind of stress we are facing right now.

Thank You.

Therefore it is becoming day by day difficult for students surrounded around affected areas to carry on online classes ,test preparation and covering the hospital prerequisites at same pace .
Already up government ordered closing of all modes of education online / offline for colleges till 15 may , 2021 .
Source-https://bit.ly/3xE3U6K
Thus , we request you to kindly suspend the classes for atleast 2 weeks and furthermore postponement of cia 1 . Flexibilty in attendance will also be of great help .

20/09/2021, 11:41 - +91 98114 77022: Reminder: Invitation for the students of JSS Academy Of Technical Education for Bolt's All-India Innovation Challenge - 4
To participate, the students will have to answer any one of the scholarship tests below:

Web Development Training Scholarship: https://info.boltiot.com/webdevelopmentscholarship
Internet of Things and Machine Learning Scholarship: https://info.boltiot.com/iotmlscholarship
 


 

What are the steps for Bolt's Innovation Challenge?
 

Step 1: Students will have to answer a scholarship test and qualify for the same by scoring at least 70% marks. This is a short test and will not take more than 10 minutes for the students. This ensures that they can answer it without spending much time if they have exams ongoing.

 

The selected students will be eligible to join either of Bolt's trainings at an 80% discount. We charge a small fee to cover our costs and to ensure that only interested students join the program.

 

 

To answer the scholarship, students have to visit either of the following links. They can choose to answer either of the two scholarship tests based on the training they want to take up. They could also opt for both:

Web Development Training: Scholarship link https://info.boltiot.com/webdevelopmentscholarship
Internet of Things and Machine Learning Training: Scholarship link https://info.boltiot.com/iotmlscholarship
 

Step 2: Our team of developers will train the students on the concepts of the training. Upon completion of the training, each student will be issued a certificate which can be submitted to the college/university as per the AICTE rules.

 

Step 3: The students have to build an innovative project in the area of IoT and ML or Web Development by applying the learnings of the training.

 

Step 4: The winners will be judged by engineers who have worked at prestigious organizations like Amazon, Larsen & Toubro Infotech, etc. Students will be eligible for exciting cash prizes of Rs. 30,000/- and more. 

 

 

 

Certificate for colleges and faculties:
 

Certificate for colleges: As part of this program, we will be awarding the top 3 colleges with maximum students that qualify for the final round. We will be issuing a certificate and a trophy to each of these colleges.
Certificate for faculty: A certificate of appreciation for individual faculty members who ensure 20+ applications for the Innovation Challenge from their college, for embracing remote learning, teaching and ensuring that education did not stop even during a pandemic.
Other critical points:
The option of full refund: In case the students are not happy with the training offered to them, then they can get a full refund as per the refund policy. This ensures that there is no risk for students or the faculty involved in the process. 
Lifetime access: Students can register now and start the training after the exams or at any other time.
 

Deadline to register:

The last date to avail of the scholarship and register for the Innovation Challenge is TOMORROW, 21st of September 2021. Keeping this in mind, please inform your students about the scholarship and competition at the earliest.

As per Dr.APJ AKTU B. Tech second year syllabus, All the B.Tech second year students have to study KNC-301 and KNC-302 subjects . It was found that out of second year students around 366 students had carry over papers in  KNC 301 /KNC 302 in 2019-20. These 366 students have to repeat the Moocs courses once again. 

Therefore all the HoDs are requested to ask your  department  B. Tech third year students to reset their password through the URL: prutor.ai/my-account/lost-password/.  Attend the internal quizzes/assignments  and fill the  carry over examination form along with regular paper during the session 2021-22 and clear the subjects.   

If any student is unable to register their names under moocs may contact the Registrar office.

To help students crack top jobs & Internships in the market and further help colleges to increase their placement statistics we bring you the best off-campus jobs & Internships that opened this week.

Kindly share these Internship Opportunities with students soon, a few of them would expire in the next couple of days

Apart from these top Internships, 100+ companies are hiring freshers in domains like software development, product development, business analyst. Students can access all these Internships here - https://www.cantileverlabs.com/jobs-for-freshers

Cracking the top companies can be hard, as students would be competing against others at the national level. To further help them crack these companies easily we are giving access to our premium toolkits for free 

Art & Science of Resume Making Master Class (By Avanish Mundhra, Ex-Global Head Recruiter for 15+ years, CEO Cantilever Labs)

This session will help students better understand details of resume making like: 

RESUME building as per Industry Standards 
Follow proper resume writing guidelines
Create unique resumes instead of using resume templates
Write a cover letter that gets noticed
Avoid the most common resume mistakes
Resume Binder Toolkit  
200+ Top IITians RESUMEs

And above all, it will deliver better results to increase your Resume getting shortlisted.

We believe the above toolkits and Internships would help students be better ready for the ongoing placement season and eventually crack top jobs & Internships.

Once again kindly share these details with students to gain the maximum benefit out of it.

04/01/2022, 13:50 - +91 98913 72928: Dear Sir/Madam
Some wrong massages are being spead among  students 
Groups  regarding COVID positive cases in JSSATE,  Noida, which is not correct. Only  three students :One each from First Year , Third and Fourth year  found positive in Girls Hostel and one  Fourth year  student  not residing in the campus are found positive. College management has taken necessary   preventive steps  to safeguard our students and keep the campus COVID free. The Students and parents are requested not to feel  worried. The college management is taking all precautions to make the students study and stay very safe and healthy.
04/01/2022, 20:17 - +91 98913 72928: <Media omitted>
04/01/2022, 21:27 - +91 91490 67557: Sir/Ma'am, three cases were reported in yesterday itself, three more cases have been reported today in the Girl's Hostel *only*. In the name of "precautions", only the students who have been tested positive are quarantined. There is no precaution or testing or enquiry of any kind for the students who have been in contact with those who have contracted the virus. 
We are eating the same mess as them, using the same washrooms and infact commuting to the examination centre sitting right next to them in the bus and giving exams sitting on the next seat. There isn't even any arrangement for mass testing of the students who are staying at a community place. I can say this because I am watching this happen everyday and there is nothing I can do but be a part of this chain. 
AKTU has basically asked to choose between our lives and our careers. Elite universities have been shut down but for AKTU conducting offline exams is more important than the health of the youth. 
AKTU is the most irresponsible university any student can get enrolled in.
